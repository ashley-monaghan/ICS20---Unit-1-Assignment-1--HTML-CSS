           <h4>ðŸ“–Backstory:</h4>
          <p>Barbara Liskov was born November 7, 1939, in Los Angeles California. She was the oldest of her parents, Jane and Moses Huberman's four children. In 1961, after she graduated high school, she got her BA in mathematics with a minor in physics at the University of California. Out of all their classmates, she and one other person were the only two women in the entire class. She later applied to some mathematics programs at Berkeley and            Princeton, however, at the time Princeton was not accepting female students, but she did get into Berkeley.</p>
    
            <h4>ðŸŽ“Education:</h4>
          <p>She changed her mind about going to Berkeley, moved to Boston, and began working at Mitre Corporation. There, she became interested in computers and programming. After working at Mitre for about a year, she took a programming job at Harvard and worked on language translation. She later went back to school and applied, again, to Berkeley, but also to Harvard and Stanford. In 1968, she became one of the first women in the United States to be awarded a Ph.D. from a computer science department. At Stanford, she worked with John McCarthy and was supported to work in artificial intelligence. The topic of her Ph.D. thesis was a computer program to play chess endgames, which she developed.</p>
    
            <h4>ðŸ’»Contribution to Computer Science?</h4>
          <p>Barbara Liskov is known for her pioneering work in the design of computer programming languages. She specifically developed two programming languages, in the 1970s, she developed CLU, and in the 1980s she developed Argus. CLU, although not really used anymore, introduced many features that are used widely now. It's also seen as a step in the development of object-oriented programming. Argus is an extension (created collaboratively with Maurice Herlihy, Paul Johnson, Robert Scheifler, and William Weihl), of CLU and utilizes most of the same syntax and semantics. Barbara is currently an Institute Professor and Ford Professor of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
