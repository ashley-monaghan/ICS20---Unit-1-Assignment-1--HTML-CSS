       <h4>Backstory:</h4>
      <p>Barbara Liskov was born November 7, 1939, in Los Angeles, California, to a Jewish family. She was the oldest out of her parent's Jane and Moses Huberman's four children. In 1961, after she graduated highschool, she got her BA in mathematics with a minor in physics at the University of California. Out of all of her classmates, herself and one other person were the only two women in the entire class. She later applied to some mathematics programs at Berkeley and Princeton, however, at the time Princeton was not accepting female students, but she did get into Berkeley.</p>
        
       <p>She changed her mind going to Berkeley and decided to move to Boston and began working at Mitre Corporation. There, she became interested in computers and programming. After working at Mitre for about a year, she took a programming job at Harvard where she worked on language translation. She later went back to school and applied, again, to Berkeley, but also to Harvard and Stanford. In 1968, she became one of the first women in the United States to be awarded a Ph.D. from a computer science department.At Stanford, she worked with John McCarthy and was supported to work in artificial intelligence. The topic of her Ph.D. thesis was a computer program to play chess endgames, which she developed.</p>
